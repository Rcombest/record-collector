# Discog-Cat Record Collector: Find Your Groove

The Discog-Cat Record Collector allows users to be more mindful of their listening habits. As a record collector, I often look at my collection and feel a tinge of guilt for letting various records collect dust, or I'll pull from the crate and wonder when the last time was that I spent time with a given album. No more! The Discog Cat Record Collector is here to help you spend more moments with the medium you love. Let the needle drop, and find your groove!
